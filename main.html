            <ul>
                <li> The USA, Europe countries, China , and south Korea have invested massive funds on developing the quantum computers. So I believe that quantum computer will be our main computer in the future. As my career goal, I want to be an important engineer who brings quantum computer can be used in commerical purpose in the industrial. </li>
                <li> I believe that I have around 50 years to shape/improve my career. Einstein lived 76 years and Newton lived 84 years.They not only gained a reputation as scientists by proving new ideas/logics that nobody had thought of at that time, but students also are learning their theories today. Therefore, my goal is to approach a problem in different point view from others to gain a reputation as an engineer and engrave my name in the textbook. So students who major in computer science in the future would learn about my theory. </li>
